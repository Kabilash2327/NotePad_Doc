What is JMeter:
---------------

Performance test application
Build using Java
Free & Open source
Recording
CLI-cmmd line
Reports

JMeter consists of:
-------------------
Menu Bar
Tool bar
Test plan area- all are tree view
Editor section
Time log and users

In a menubar--->File
New						---create new test plan
Templates				---Auto selection
Open					---Any saved test plans
Open Recent 			---Open recent file
Merge					---merge the test plan
Save					---Save test plan

How to create JMeter Test?
--------------------------
Step 1: Start JMeter
Step 2: Create a TestPlan
Step 3: Create a Thread Group(Users)
Step 4: Add a sampler (HTTP)
Step 5: Add Listeners
Step 6: Run the test


JMeter Listeners(Reporting):
-----------------------------

Used for reporting:

listener = elements that gather information about the performance test
used to view results/metrics of the test...

View Results in table
View Results Tree
Aggregate Report
Graph results
Summary report
Simple data writer

Sample ---> Users

Latency	 		= time to first byte(Start time of req)
Sample Time		= the complete time

Assertions:
-----------

Assertions = Checks on the Request and Response

1.Response Assertion
		(Most frequent Assertion of the response- we can verify response code, response message, text response, response headers)
2.Duration Assertion
		(We have to set the time limit not morethan exits(Thresold limit))
		(Whenever the samplers should not take morethan the expected milliseconds limit)
3.Size Assertion
		(The assertion is based on size, we can control the response body size based upon condition)
4.HTML Assertion
		(However incase of the application is interact with 3rd party application We need to verify the (
		warning and errors HTML or XML type of assertion)
5.XML JSON Assertion
		(Mostly for API and webservices assertion)
6.XML Schema assertion
		(To verify against with Schema of XML validation what we mentioned in the file)
6.XPATH Assertion
		(Based upon the xpath, we have to validate. The specfic element is present or not)
